      <h1>CSS colours</h1>
      <p>
        This table summarises the different ways of setting colours in CSS. Each
        example shows how to render the colour
        <span class="red">red with full opacity</span>. The two examples
        featuring an Alpha value demonstrate the
        <span class="part-opaque">slightly opaque version</span>.
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col" id="type">Type</th>
            <th scope="col" id="syntax">Syntax</th>

          <tr>
            <td>Named colours</td>
            <td>color: red;</td>
            <td>
              There are 140 named colours to choose from, including standard
              named like 'blue' and 'yellow, and more specific names like
              'salmon' and 'plum'.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Hexadecimal colours</td>
            <td>color: #ff0000;</td>
            <td>
              This is based on a counting system made up of 16 digits. The
              additional 6 digits are represented by a - f. Use a colour picker
              or the tool in the text editor itself to choose the exact colour
              you want.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">RGB(A)</td>
            <td>color: rgb(255, 0, 0);</td>
            <td>
              This stands for Red, Green, Blue, (Alpha), where Alpha is an
              optional value between 0 and 1 to represent opacity. The first
              three values can be anything between 0 and 255.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);</td>
            <td>
              Here we have added the optional Alpha value. Notice we have to now
              type "RGBA" instead of just "RGB". 0 is completely transparent and
              1 is completely opaque.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">HSL(A)</td>
            <td>color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%);</td>
            <td>
              HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness, where H refers to
              the colour itself and S and L change the saturation and light to
              result in different shades. We can use HSL to pick a set of
              colours that work well together by selecting colours that have the
              same lightness and saturation but different hue.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>color: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5);</td>
            <td>
              Just like with RGBA, the Alpha value can be between 0 (completely
              transparent) and 1 (completely opaque). Again, don't forget to use
              "HSLA" not "HSL".
            </td>
